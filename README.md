# ExtraPets2

This mod is a sort of code sandbox for me to mess around with.
Started life as a port of an old (and really bad) mod I made circa 2016.
Contains all content from that, as well as some new stuff (most of which probably sucks)

Mostly made this because I was bored. Don't expect any regularity to updates.
